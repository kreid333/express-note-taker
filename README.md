# Express Note Taker


## Description 

For this project, I had to create an application that was able to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

To use this application, run 'npm install' to install the express package (listed as a Dependency in package.json).

## Usage 

The user must run 'node server.js' in order to start their local server. After opening their local host in browser, they can then add as many notes as they please; these notes will simultaneously be saved to the JSON file that is acting as a database. The user can also delete these notes using the trash can icon; which will also delete that specific note from the JSON file that it is stored in. 

Instead of running locally, the application can also be ran here:
